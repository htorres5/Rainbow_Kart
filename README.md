# :rainbow: Rainbow Kart

### Created by: Hector Torres
### ~30 Hours

### Creative Tilt:

Mario Kart, Subway Surfers, and Rainbows. Rainbows Everywhere. After I saw the effect on Phaser Labs/Examples, I went ham. I'm proud that I found that code and stole it. :3

Ok but for real, I'm really just proud of the whole game itself. This the first time I felt that all the techniques I've learned from game development came together and let me create Rainbow Kart. I'm proud that the item spawning system works perfectly, which was also the hardest thing to implement. I love how the games visuals turned out, and I love Peritune and its Artists for providing bangers for free. I don't think I tried anything clever or new, the gameplay loop is pretty much the same as Subway Surfers. The only thing new about it is the Rainbows. Rainbows everywhere. :rainbow:
